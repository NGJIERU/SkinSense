## Project Details

### Web Application Title

SkinSense

### Target Users

- Skin products vendors
- Individuals interested in purchasing skincare products
- Individuals interested in starting their skincare business

### Brief Project Description

The project involves the development of a comprehensive website where sellers can showcase and sell their skincare products. The platform will offer an intuitive interface for both sellers and buyers, facilitating seamless transactions and interactions. Sellers will have the ability to create profiles, list their products, manage inventory, and engage with customers. On the other hand, buyers will have access to a diverse range of skincare products, detailed product information, secure payment options, and a personalized shopping experience.

### Problem Statement

Despite the growing demand for skincare products, both sellers and buyers often encounter challenges in the current market scenario. Sellers struggle to reach a broader audience and establish a credible online presence for their products. On the other hand, buyers face difficulties in finding authentic skincare products from trustworthy sources. Existing platforms may lack features tailored specifically for skincare products, leading to a fragmented and unsatisfactory user experience.

### Project Objectives

1. Creating a centralized platform for skincare product sellers to showcase and sell their products.
2. Providing buyers with a convenient and secure online marketplace to explore and purchase skincare products.
3. Fostering entrepreneurship by empowering individuals to start their skincare businesses with minimal barriers to entry.
